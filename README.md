# ðŸ¦‡ Famiglio

> A loyal familiar watching over your code, silently weaving automation into your repositories.

Famiglio is a Node.js service built with Nx, designed to act as your GitHub App companion.  
Once fully awakened, it will:

- Observe repository events â€” pushes, pull requests, releases â€” like eyes in the shadows.
- Perform automated rituals: managing releases, validating code, and updating dependencies.
- Whisper notifications and insights about your repositoryâ€™s hidden movements.
- Serve as a mystical hub, orchestrating tasks across all your projects without mortal intervention.

Think of Famiglio as a silent guardian, quietly ensuring that your repositories remain in order while you focus on creation.
