## 2. Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
   The security issue must be reported to me privately.

2. Contact me directly at: **davidedc@outlook.com**
   (or via GitHub Private Security Advisory, if you prefer).

3. Please include as much detail as possible:
   - The affected version(s)
   - Steps to reproduce
   - The potential impact

## 3. Responsible Disclosure

I kindly ask that you:

- Give me a reasonable amount of time to investigate and patch before public disclosure.
- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability beyond what is necessary for a proof of concept.
- Coordinate with me on the disclosure timeline.
